        Hey! We are Minto ‚Äî a Bitcoin mining platform.

        *Mining is simple. Don't you believe it? Try to mine with us!*

        We've removed all the unnecessary steps. To mine BTC, all you need is to buy and stake our BTCMT token, that equals a unit of Bitcoin mining power. 
        Our token is secured by actively operating equipment. To make it work **we use renewable energy sources with a neutral carbon footprint**. 

        Visit our [website](https://minto.finance/) and learn more about our project!
